Simple **EEPROM programmer**. Powered by Arduino and controller over the Terminal. Useful for those following [Ben Eater's 6502 pc course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU).

### What Amanuensis does...

- Lets you read individual **addresses** and whole **blocks** of memory.
- Allows you to burn a `.bin` file onto the EEPROM and to write **individual** values to specific addresses.
- Lets you erase the whole memory by **overwrtting** it with a certain value.

</p>

All of this with through a **Command Line Interface** directly from yout laptop.

> **Note**
> Software tested on **macOS** Monterey. It might be compatible with Linux-based systems with minor/no changes.

> **Warning**
> Developped for **28c256 EEPROM** which has 32K addresses each storing 8-bit values.
> Use for other parallel EEPROMs might be possible. Check section [Usage with other EEPROMs](#usage-with-other-eeproms).

## How It Works

Your laptop's Command Line Interface interacts with Arduino over the serial port. At the same time, the Arduino drives **read/write pulse cycles** onto the parallel EEPROM. It sends back the information to Arduino, which passes it back to your laptop's Command Line Interface.

These read/write pulse cycles can be found the [datasheet](https://eater.net/datasheets/28c256.pdf) of the **28c256 parallel EEPROM**.

## Quick Use Guide

To see all available options:

    nuensis read --help
    nuensis write --help

#### Writting a File (`-f`):

      nuensis write --file my_file.bin

`my_file.bin` should hold its contents in a **bytearray**. Example of creation of such a file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
rom = bytearray([0xea]*32768)

rom[0x0000] = 0xaa
rom[0x002b] = 0xbb

with open("my_file.bin", "wb") as file:
  file.write(rom)
```

This results in data `0xaa` stored in address `0x0000` and `0xbb` stored in `0x002b`.

> **Note**
> During file writting, values in the bytearray with **No-Operation** instruction (`0xea`) are ignored. In other words, `0xea` must be used as a placeholder.

#### Writting a Single Value (`-v`):

    nuensis write --value 0123 ef  # Writes value 0xef to address 0x0123

#### Overwritting Whole Memory (`-w`):

    nuensis write --whole ea  # Writes value 0xea in all addresses.

> **Warning**
> This operation may take a while.

#### Reading Single Memory Address (`-a`):

    nuensis read --address 0123  # Reads address 0x0123

#### Reading Memory Range (`-r`):

    nuensis read --range 0000 004f  # Reads from address 0x0000 to 0x004f

 <img src="./assets/nuensis_read.gif" alt="Showcase GIF" width=90%>
</p>


#### Reading Whole Memory (`-w`):

      nuensis read --whole  # Reads from 0x0000 to 0x7fff


> **Note**
> EEPROM 28c256 has 15-bit memory registers. They range from 0 (`0x0000`) to 32767 (`0x7fff`).

## Setup

## Hardware Setup

<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/overall_hardware.png" alt="Hardware components" width=75%>
</p>

An **Arduino Mega** drives the **EEPROM 28c256** through a custom made **Shield**:

<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/shield.png" alt="Hardware components" width=50%>
</p>

The **Shield** performs the following pin mapping:

|    EEPROM     | Pin | Arduino |
| :-----------: | :-: | :-----: |
| Write Enable  | WE  |   32    |
| Output Enable | OE  |   52    |
|  Chip Enable  | CE  |   29    |
|    Data 0     | D0  |   49    |
|    Data 1     | D1  |   41    |
|    Data 2     | D2  |   39    |
|    Data 3     | D3  |   35    |
|    Data 4     | D4  |   33    |
|    Data 5     | D5  |   23    |
|    Data 6     | D6  |   25    |
|    Data 7     | D7  |   27    |
|   Address 0   | A0  |   47    |
|   Address 1   | A1  |   45    |
|   Address 2   | A2  |   51    |
|   Address 3   | A3  |   50    |
|   Address 4   | A4  |   44    |
|   Address 5   | A5  |   46    |
|   Address 6   | A6  |   48    |
|   Address 7   | A7  |   40    |
|   Address 8   | A8  |   24    |
|   Address 9   | A9  |   26    |
|  Address 10   | A10 |   53    |
|  Address 11   | A11 |   28    |
|  Address 12   | A12 |   38    |
|  Address 13   | A13 |   32    |
|  Address 14   | A14 |   36    |

A different mapping might be defined in `./Amanuensis.cpp`.

## Software Installation

1. Clone or download this repo and place it in your **path** of preference (e.g. `./Documents`).

> **Warning**
> Moving the repo folder will break the paths of the binaries. To avoid this, follow the steps in **[Moving the `amanuensis` folder](#moving-the-amanuensis-folder)**.

#### Arduino setup

2. Install Arduino **Amanuensis** library by placing it in the `Arduino/libraries` folder, usually found in `~/Documents`.

<p align="center">
 <img src="./assets/arduino_install.gif" alt="Installing Arduino library" width=80%>
</p>

3. Upload `EEPROMinterface.ino` to your Arduino board.

#### Laptop setup

4. Install Python requirements:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Move to the amanuensis folder, wherever you placed it, (`cd [your-path]/amanuensis`) and run `./install.sh`.

To test the installation, open a new terminal window and type `nuensis -h`.

#### Moving the `amanuensis` folder

The Command Line Interface (CLI) relies on finding the PATH of the `amanuensis` folder, which was set when running `install.sh`. Therefore, if the folder is moved around, the CLI commands will fail. To solve it:

1. Move the `amanuensis` folder to the new desired destination.
2. Open `./bash_profile` and delete the entry `source [your-path]/nuensis.sh`
3. cd to the new folder location and re-run `./install.sh`.

## Recommended Writting Procedure:

1. Erase all memory contents and set them to a known value, like **No-Operation** `0xea`:

   nuensis write --whole ea

2. Create your own `program.bin` as described in **[Writting a File](<#writting-a-file-(f)>)**

   nuensis write --file program.bin

3. Check that the contents are what you wanted them to be:

## Use With Other EEPROMs

`Amanuensis` should work with other **parallel** EEPROMs as long as they respond to the same read/write pulse cycles as the **28c256** (e.g. 28c64):

</p>

However, the code might have to be changed to fit your particular EEPROM needs. This is a quick checklist:

- [ ] Confirm that the working voltage of your EEPROM is correctly set (in my case, Vcc is 5V, provided by Arduino).
- [ ] Revisit the **pin mapping**, defined in `amanuensis/src/Amanuensis.cpp`.
- [ ] Set the max address of your EEPROM in ... (e.g., for 15-bit addresses, `MAX_ADDRESS=32767`).
