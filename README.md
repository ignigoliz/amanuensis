### What Amanuensis does...
- Lets you read individual **addresses** and whole **blocks** of memory.
- Allows you to burn a `.bin` file onto the ROM and to write **individual** values.
- Lets you erase the whole memory by **overwrtting** it with a certain value.

An all of this with through a **Command Line Interface** directly from yout laptop.

> **Note**
> Software tested on **macOS** Monterey. It might be compatible with Linux-based systems with minor/no changes.

> **Warning**
> Developped for **28c256 EEPROM** which has 32K addresses each storing 8-bit values.
> Use for other parallel EEPROMs might be possible. Check section [Use with other EEPROMs](#use-with-other-eeproms).
